		description="A moving, grainy light field behind an element, drawn on the GPU. Soft glows drift, form and dissolve, a fine sparkle flows through them, and the pointer pushes them along and lights the field under it. It follows the site's light and dark theme, and it can also change theme as the page scrolls. It only runs while the element is on screen, and with reduced motion it draws one still frame. A site uses one instance: on a section, or on `<body>` with `fixed`, where sections should have no background of their own. Every option is optional, and the groups (`lobes`, `ripple`, `turbulence`, `mouse`, `crease`, `vignette`) take only the values you set."

Use `rect`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `path` and `polygon` without a `transform`. An `<img>` keeps its shapes out of reach, so it is drawn to a canvas instead and every grid point on a solid pixel gets a dot. That works for an SVG file and for any picture with transparency, such as a PNG or WebP cut-out, as long as it comes from your own site or allows cross-origin reads. On an `<img>` the sizes are in px and the dots are redone when it resizes. The dots only move while it is on screen, and stay still when motion is reduced."
